This project was undertaken for the presentation of an in-depth 10-week research initiative resulting in the delivery of key insights during a seminar for Gulf of Maine Research Institute personnel and shareholders on the economic impacts of climate-induced species redistribution. The R scripts extract and analyze historical port-level data from 1964-2022 that employ novel economic metrics like the Theil index to quantify the distribution of fishery revenues under different management systems. I created integrated datasets that support developing predictive models for sustainable fisheries practices tailored to evolving climate scenarios.
